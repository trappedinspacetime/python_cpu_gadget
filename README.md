In the 2010s, there were desktop widgets called Screenlets designed with Python 2. These were visually appealing and highly useful indicators. However, with the transition to Python 3, these widgets became incompatible and stopped working. Since no one took the effort to convert these applications from Python 2 to Python 3, we were deprived of them. Now, although this is a simplified version, I have demonstrated that these applications can be recreated. I hope you find it useful.
